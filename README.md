EMGShield
=========

This project deals with the bio signal EMG (Electromyogram) and its potential as a control signal in connection with the Microcontroller-platform Arduino. The platform offers different pluggable modules, so called Shields, where unfortunately a professional EMG-Shield is missing. Due to this fact a first EMG-Shield prototype was developed. This process included the simulation of the electrical circuits, the implementation of these circuits on a breadboard and finally the verification. For this, a ping-pong-game was modified to test the ability of the EMG-signal as control-input. The test-application showed that it’s possible to control a ping-pong-game quite comfortable just by the power of a muscle. This underlines the high controlling-potential of the EMG-signal and motivates for further developments. Consequently, the circuit board, shown in our first video, has now been integrated to an Arduino Shield. The wiring and the software will soon be available online.
